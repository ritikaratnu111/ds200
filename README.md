## Scatter Plot
The x-axis shows area of all the states/union territories.Y-axis shows the tree cover of the particular state.
Source:https://data.gov.in/resources/stateut-wise-tree-cover-estimates-isfr-2011 

Why Scatter Plot:We can easily see which states have a greater tree area based on wheter they lie above the general trend or below.

Observations: The trend is more or less linear showing that the tree-cover is almost constant in all the states proportional to their size.

## Bar Plot
The x-axis shows years.Y-axis shows the foreign exchange reserves in  Indian currency(billion).
Source:https://data.gov.in/resources/foreign-exchange-reserves-upto-2011 

Why Bar Plot:We have a single variable. x-axis data is discrete.

Observations:The reserves increase almost exponentially during the period of 200-2012.

## Box Plot
The x-axis shows year 2001 and 2011.Y-axis shows the literacy (discrete literacy rates o all the states and union territories).
Source:https://data.gov.in/catalog/state-wise-literacy-rates 

Why Box Plot:The size of the two data do not vary greatly. We can also infer median literacy rates.

Observations:There is a significant increase in literacy rates. The minimum rate of 2011 is better than the median of 2001 representing a positive trend.
